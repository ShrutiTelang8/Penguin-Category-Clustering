# K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning tool to group similar unlabeled data or to identify patterns outside of existing categorizations in labelled data. 

# All data is from the palmerpenguins package authored by Alison Hill and Kristen Gorman. The dataset contains statistics on 344 penguins from the Palmer Archipelago near Palmer Station, Antarctica. 17 columns comprise statistics on size, clutch and blood isotope ratios, as well as categorical variables such as island, species and region.
